<h2> Introduction </h2>

The Logistics Program is the final project for the course ENSF 409 given by Dr. Ann Barcomb and Emily Marasco at the University of Calgary. The purpose of the project is to create a program that finds the best food item combination from a given database for a number of user inputted clients. 

The program should be able to handle multiple hampers and orders and the given database should update as hampers are created. The program should also create a ext file with the orderlist once an order has been created.

<h2> Installing, compiling, and running the program </h2>

You can download the program from the Group 30: Project - Final Package dropbox in the ENSF 409 course on D2L or you can alternatively download it from the github repository for the program.

To compile the program, first open your computer's terminal. Then, go to the directory where the program file is located. You can move between directories using the command cd [FOLDER]. 
After moving to the right directory, type the command javac edu/ucalgary/ensf409/*.java, this will compile the program classes that exist within the edu.ucalgary.ensf409 package.

After compiling the program, you can run it by typing the command java edu/ucalgary/ensf409/GUI.java. Once you run the command, a graphical user interface will pop up and you'll be able to use the program.
